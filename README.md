# SSBT DIGITAL

# WHY?

SSBT Digital required a portfolio site to attract potential clients. Information about the team showcases the talents of SSBT both individually and as a team and therefore encourages clients to make contact. A simple design allows clients to quickly navigate through the information, and an easy to use and accessible contact form allows messages to be sent quickly and easily to SSBT.

# WHAT?

SSBT DIGITAL is a one page site that:
* Is easy to navigate, read and understand
* Offers accessible content for all
* Focusses on UX
* Is responsive on all device sizes
* Has a contact form that submits a message *and* provides enough contact information from the user

# HOW?

Our group - **SSBT** - worked as a team (mainly in pairs) to create our site.

<u>**Initial Planning**</u>

We discussed the basic layout and design of the site as well as its purpose. We came to the conclusion that we would keep things simple as it was our first project and we wanted to focus on usability.

We discussed topics such as:
* Layout and design
* User Experience
* Accessibility
* Responsiveness

Questions we asked were:
* Would we create a mobile first site?
* Which tools would we use to test accessibility?

<u>**Practical Work**</u>

First of all we divided the site into 2 parts:

1. Nav bar, Header and About
2. Team, Contact form and footer section.

We worked in pairs on these sections while swapping tasks and partners every now and again. We communicated our issues and discussed group decisions throughout.

What would we do differently next time?
* Relate our Git Commit messages to specific issues raised on GitHub using e.g. ```relative #2``` within the comment.


<u>**Testing**</u>
* ChromeVox
    * Accessibility levels on the Nav bar and contact form are good
    *  We had issues making the entire site fully accessible.
* Developer Tools
    * 99% on audits
    * The ```alt``` attribute on Google Maps needed to be put in place to ensure JavaScript didn't make any users feel excluded.
* HTML 5 Outliner
    * Generally speaking the site is well laid out - logical order.
    * A couple of sections are classed as 'untitled' as we aren't using headers for all sections.
        * These should be made headings and then hidden?
